I'm trying to improve my skills as Frontend Developer by trying to clone a Figma UI/UX design in code. This was my second project and im pretty happy with the results. Still have a lot to improve and learn but step by step im growing as Front Developer and that's making me so happy!

I leave you the results in the next screenshots! Hope that you like it :)

Im also gonna leave here a direct link to another project which is similar to this one but focusing at restaurant web service:
